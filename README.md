# Portfolio
This is a portfolio site repository. The original was made in a couple of hours
at HackISU Fall 2016, so I decided to use ReactJS to create a better, revamped
version.

## Goals
My Goal with this project was to have fun using potentially very out there
design and animation with inspiration from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com).
Also, I wanted more practice using ReactJS and Sass for a static site instead
of a complex web app.
